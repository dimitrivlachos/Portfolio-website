# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website. It is built using Vite, Vue, and TailwindCSS.

This project is meant to be a single location to find all of the professional information you may need about me,
including my resume, portfolio, and contact information. It also serves as a blog to document my journey as a
developer, serving double-duty as a way to share my experiences while also being part of my portfolio.

Goals for this project include:
- [ ] Front page / landing page
- [ ] CV / Resume
- [ ] Portfolio
- [ ] Blog
